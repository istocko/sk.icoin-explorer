upgrade

# Add or replace object fields.  This example assumes connect-args

# If "policy" is not given in datadir, it defaults to the chain name,
# but for new coins, a "policy" parameter is required.  Run
# "python -m Abe.abe --list-policies" to see the possibilities, and
# "python -m Abe.abe --show-policy POLICY" for information about
# POLICY.  When in doubt, look for the name of a coin on which the new
# coin is based, or a name suggestive of its distinctive features such
# as proof-of-work hash algorithm.  If no policy works, see the
# modules in Abe/Chain for examples.  Each module there implements a
# policy.

# New coins typically need a new "address_version", see doc/FAQ.html.
